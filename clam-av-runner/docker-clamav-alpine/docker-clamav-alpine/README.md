## About

### Alpine
This image offers all the same options like the original one. It is based on Alpine Linux and this time providing easy extensions via configuration files.

Alpine version reduces foot print to something about less than 5%, compressed size in docker hub is 6.72 MB compared to debian 216.21 MB.

### Provides
Dockerized open source antivirus daemons for use with 
- file sharing containers like [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/) or 
- to use it via a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) proxy like [@solita](https://github.com/solita) made [clamav-rest](https://github.com/solita/clamav-rest) or
- to directly connect to *clamav* via TCP port `3310`

## Description
ClamAV daemon as a Docker image. It *builds* with a current virus database and
*runs* `freshclam` in the background constantly updating the virus signature database. `clamd` itself
is listening on exposed port `3310`.

## docker-compose

See example with Nextcloud at [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mko-x/docker-clamav/blob/alpine/docker-compose.yml).

You can simply provide your own configurations via volume substitution.

# Use it with custom configurations of clamd and freshclam

Start with this one in your own Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM mk0x/docker-clamav:alpine
COPY your/clamd.conf /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
COPY your/freshclam.conf /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf

```
